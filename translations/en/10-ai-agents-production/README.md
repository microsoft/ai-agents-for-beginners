# AI Agents in Production: Observability & Evaluation

As AI agents transition from experimental prototypes to real-world applications, it becomes crucial to understand their behavior, monitor their performance, and systematically evaluate their outputs.

## Learning Goals

After completing this lesson, you will understand:
- The core concepts of agent observability and evaluation
- Techniques to improve the performance, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness of agents
- What to evaluate and how to systematically assess your AI agents
- How to manage costs when deploying AI agents in production
- How to instrument agents built with AutoGen

The goal is to equip you with the knowledge to transform your "black box" agents into transparent, manageable, and reliable systems.

_**Note:** Deploying safe and trustworthy AI agents is essential. Check out the [Building Trustworthy AI Agents](./06-building-trustworthy-agents/README.md) lesson as well._

## Traces and Spans

Observability tools like [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) or [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) often represent agent runs as traces and spans.

- **Trace**: Represents a complete agent task from start to finish (e.g., handling a user query).
- **Spans**: Represent individual steps within the trace (e.g., calling a language model or retrieving data).

Without observability, an AI agent can feel like a "black box"‚Äîits internal state and reasoning are opaque, making it difficult to diagnose issues or optimize performance. Observability transforms agents into "glass boxes," providing the transparency needed to build trust and ensure they operate as intended.

## Why Observability Matters in Production Environments

Deploying AI agents in production introduces new challenges and requirements. Observability becomes a critical capability rather than a "nice-to-have":

*   **Debugging and Root-Cause Analysis**: When an agent fails or produces unexpected outputs, observability tools provide traces that help pinpoint the source of the error. This is especially important for complex agents involving multiple LLM calls, tool interactions, and conditional logic.
*   **Latency and Cost Management**: AI agents often rely on LLMs and external APIs billed per token or call. Observability enables precise tracking of these calls, helping identify operations that are too slow or expensive. Teams can optimize prompts, choose more efficient models, or redesign workflows to manage costs and ensure a good user experience.
*   **Trust, Safety, and Compliance**: In many applications, ensuring agents behave safely and ethically is critical. Observability provides an audit trail of agent actions and decisions, which can help detect and mitigate issues like prompt injection, harmful content generation, or mishandling of personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you can review traces to understand why an agent provided a specific response or used a particular tool.
*   **Continuous Improvement Loops**: Observability data forms the foundation for iterative development. By monitoring real-world agent performance, teams can identify areas for improvement, gather data for fine-tuning models, and validate the impact of changes. This creates a feedback loop where production insights from online evaluation inform offline experimentation, leading to progressively better agent performance.

## Key Metrics to Track

To monitor and understand agent behavior, a variety of metrics and signals should be tracked. While specific metrics may vary depending on the agent's purpose, some are universally important.

Here are some of the most common metrics monitored by observability tools:

**Latency:** How quickly does the agent respond? Long wait times negatively impact user experience. Measure latency for both tasks and individual steps by tracing agent runs. For example, if an agent takes 20 seconds for all model calls, you could speed it up by using a faster model or running model calls in parallel.

**Costs:** What is the expense per agent run? AI agents rely on LLM calls billed per token or external APIs. Frequent tool usage or multiple prompts can quickly increase costs. For instance, if an agent calls an LLM five times for marginal quality improvement, you should assess whether the cost is justified or if you could reduce the number of calls or use a cheaper model. Real-time monitoring can also help identify unexpected cost spikes (e.g., bugs causing excessive API loops).

**Request Errors:** How many requests did the agent fail? This includes API errors or failed tool calls. To make your agent more robust in production, you can set up fallbacks or retries. For example, if LLM provider A is down, switch to LLM provider B as a backup.

**User Feedback:** Direct user evaluations provide valuable insights. This can include explicit ratings (üëç/üëé, ‚≠ê1-5 stars) or textual comments. Consistent negative feedback signals that the agent is not meeting expectations.

**Implicit User Feedback:** User behaviors provide indirect feedback even without explicit ratings. This includes immediate question rephrasing, repeated queries, or clicking a retry button. For example, if users repeatedly ask the same question, it indicates the agent is not performing as expected.

**Accuracy:** How often does the agent produce correct or desirable outputs? Accuracy definitions vary (e.g., problem-solving correctness, information retrieval accuracy, user satisfaction). Start by defining what success looks like for your agent. Track accuracy through automated checks, evaluation scores, or task completion labels. For example, mark traces as "succeeded" or "failed."

**Automated Evaluation Metrics:** Set up automated evaluations. For instance, use an LLM to score the agent's output for helpfulness, accuracy, or other criteria. Open-source libraries like [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/) for RAG agents or [LLM Guard](https://llm-guard.com/) for detecting harmful language or prompt injection can assist with scoring.

In practice, a combination of these metrics provides the best coverage of an AI agent‚Äôs health. In this chapter's [example notebook](../../../10-ai-agents-production/code_samples/10_autogen_evaluation.ipynb), we'll demonstrate how these metrics look in real examples. But first, let's explore a typical evaluation workflow.

## Instrument your Agent

To collect tracing data, you‚Äôll need to instrument your code. The goal is to enable the agent code to emit traces and metrics that can be captured, processed, and visualized by an observability platform.

**OpenTelemetry (OTel):** [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an industry standard for LLM observability. It provides APIs, SDKs, and tools for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data.

Many instrumentation libraries wrap existing agent frameworks, making it easy to export OpenTelemetry spans to an observability tool. Below is an example of instrumenting an AutoGen agent with the [OpenLit instrumentation library](https://github.com/openlit/openlit):

```python
import openlit

openlit.init(tracer = langfuse._otel_tracer, disable_batch = True)
```

The [example notebook](../../../10-ai-agents-production/code_samples/10_autogen_evaluation.ipynb) in this chapter demonstrates how to instrument your AutoGen agent.

**Manual Span Creation:** While instrumentation libraries provide a good baseline, there are cases where more detailed or custom information is needed. You can manually create spans to add custom application logic. Additionally, you can enrich spans with custom attributes (tags or metadata) such as `user_id`, `session_id`, or `model_version`.

Example of manually creating traces and spans with the [Langfuse Python SDK](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3): 

```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
span = langfuse.start_span(name="my-span")
 
span.end()
```

## Agent Evaluation

Observability provides metrics, but evaluation involves analyzing that data (and performing tests) to determine how well an AI agent is performing and how it can be improved. In other words, once you have traces and metrics, how do you use them to assess the agent and make decisions?

Regular evaluation is essential because AI agents are often non-deterministic and can evolve (due to updates or model drift). Without evaluation, you wouldn‚Äôt know if your "smart agent" is performing well or has regressed.

There are two categories of evaluations for AI agents: **online evaluation** and **offline evaluation**. Both are valuable and complement each other. Offline evaluation is typically the first step before deploying any agent.

### Offline Evaluation

![Dataset items in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/example-autogen-evaluation/example-dataset.png)

Offline evaluation involves testing the agent in a controlled environment, typically using test datasets rather than live user queries. Curated datasets with known expected outputs or correct behaviors are used to evaluate the agent.

For example, if you built a math word-problem agent, you might use a [test dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsm8k) of 100 problems with known answers. Offline evaluation is often conducted during development (and can be part of CI/CD pipelines) to check for improvements or guard against regressions. The advantage is that it‚Äôs **repeatable and provides clear accuracy metrics since you have ground truth**. You might also simulate user queries and compare the agent‚Äôs responses to ideal answers or use automated metrics as described earlier.

The challenge with offline evaluation is ensuring your test dataset is comprehensive and remains relevant. The agent might perform well on a fixed test set but struggle with different queries in production. Therefore, test sets should be updated with new edge cases and examples reflecting real-world scenarios. A mix of small "smoke test" cases and larger evaluation sets is useful: small sets for quick checks and larger ones for broader performance metrics.

### Online Evaluation 

![Observability metrics overview](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/example-autogen-evaluation/dashboard.png)

Online evaluation involves assessing the agent in a live, real-world environment during actual usage in production. This includes monitoring the agent‚Äôs performance on real user interactions and continuously analyzing outcomes.

For example, you might track success rates, user satisfaction scores, or other metrics on live traffic. The advantage of online evaluation is that it **captures scenarios you might not anticipate in a controlled setting**. You can observe model drift over time (e.g., if the agent‚Äôs effectiveness degrades as input patterns change) and identify unexpected queries or situations not covered in your test data. It provides a true picture of how the agent behaves in the wild.

Online evaluation often involves collecting implicit and explicit user feedback, as discussed earlier, and possibly running shadow tests or A/B tests (where a new version of the agent runs in parallel to compare against the old). The challenge is obtaining reliable labels or scores for live interactions, which may rely on user feedback or downstream metrics (e.g., whether the user clicked the result).

### Combining the two

Online and offline evaluations are not mutually exclusive; they complement each other. Insights from online monitoring (e.g., new types of user queries where the agent performs poorly) can be used to enhance offline test datasets. Conversely, agents that perform well in offline tests can be more confidently deployed and monitored online.

Many teams adopt a loop:

_evaluate offline -> deploy -> monitor online -> collect new failure cases -> add to offline dataset -> refine agent -> repeat_.

## Common Issues

As you deploy AI agents to production, you may encounter various challenges. Here are some common issues and potential solutions:

| **Issue**    | **Potential Solution**   |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| AI Agent not performing tasks consistently | - Refine the prompt given to the AI Agent; be clear on objectives.<br>- Identify where dividing the tasks into subtasks and handling them by multiple agents can help. |
| AI Agent running into continuous loops  | - Ensure you have clear termination terms and conditions so the Agent knows when to stop the process.<br>- For complex tasks that require reasoning and planning, use a larger model that is specialized for reasoning tasks. |
| AI Agent tool calls are not performing well   | - Test and validate the tool's output outside of the agent system. |

- Refine the defined parameters, prompts, and naming of tools.  |
| Multi-Agent system not performing consistently | - Adjust the prompts given to each agent to ensure they are clear and distinct from one another.<br>- Create a hierarchical system using a "routing" or controller agent to decide which agent is the most appropriate. |

Many of these issues can be identified more effectively with proper observability in place. The traces and metrics we discussed earlier help pinpoint exactly where problems occur in the agent workflow, making debugging and optimization much more efficient.

## Managing Costs

Here are some strategies to manage the costs of deploying AI agents to production:

**Using Smaller Models:** Small Language Models (SLMs) can perform well for certain agent-based use cases and significantly reduce costs. As mentioned earlier, building an evaluation system to compare performance against larger models is the best way to understand how well an SLM will work for your specific use case. Consider using SLMs for simpler tasks like intent classification or parameter extraction, while reserving larger models for tasks requiring complex reasoning.

**Using a Router Model:** Another strategy is to use a mix of models with varying sizes. You can use an LLM/SLM or serverless function to route requests based on their complexity to the most suitable models. This approach helps reduce costs while ensuring optimal performance for the right tasks. For example, route simple queries to smaller, faster models, and reserve expensive large models for tasks requiring complex reasoning.

**Caching Responses:** Identifying common requests and tasks and providing pre-generated responses before they pass through your agent system is an effective way to reduce the volume of similar requests. You can even implement a process to determine how similar a new request is to your cached responses using simpler AI models. This strategy can significantly lower costs for frequently asked questions or recurring workflows.

## Let's see how this works in practice

In the [example notebook for this section](../../../10-ai-agents-production/code_samples/10_autogen_evaluation.ipynb), we‚Äôll explore examples of how observability tools can be used to monitor and evaluate our agent.
